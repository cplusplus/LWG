https://github.com/cplusplus/LWG is the repository for the C++ Standards Committee's
Library Working Group issues lists files. 

When cloning this repo you should use the `--single-branch` option to
avoid fetching the automatically generated HTML pages in the `gh-pages`
branch. The contents of the `gh-pages` branch are 100 times larger than
the `master` branch, but only the `master` branch is useful.

For the most recent draft of the lists generated from these files, see
https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-active.html

For the official (but less up-to-date) versions of these lists, see
https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/
