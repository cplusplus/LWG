[thread.decaycopy] says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
In several places in this Clause the operation <tt><i>DECAY_COPY</i>(x)</tt> is used. All such uses mean call the function 
<tt>decay_copy(x)</tt> and use the result, where <tt>decay_copy</tt> is defined as follows:
</p></blockquote>
<p>
but <tt>decay_copy</tt> is not defined in any synopsis.
<p/>
The Ranges TS has a similar use of <tt><i>DECAY_COPY</i></tt>, except that theirs is also <tt>constexpr</tt> and <tt>noexcept</tt>.
<p/>
We should mark the function <tt>decay_copy</tt> as "exposition only" and <tt>constexpr</tt> and <tt>noexcept</tt>.

<p>
Currently there exists no proper way to mark <tt>decay_copy</tt> as conditionally <tt>noexcept</tt> as explained in
<a href="https://wg21.link/n3255#Adding">N3255 section "Adding to the Standard"</a>. This is also slighly related to 
the request to add an <tt>is_nothrow_convertible</tt> trait, as requested by LWG <iref ref="2040"/>.

Starting with <a href="https://wg21.link/n4800">N4800</a> have now a <tt>constexpr</tt> and conditionally <tt>noexcept</tt> 
<tt><i>decay-copy</i></tt> in the working draft (<sref ref="[expos.only.func]"/>). The pre-condition for that specification 
helper became possible by adoption of <a href="https://wg21.link/p0758r1">P0758R1</a>, which introduced the missing
<tt>is_nothrow_convertible</tt> trait.
