    <title>string::erase(iterator) validity</title>

<p>
23.1.1, p3 along with Table 67 specify as a prerequisite for a.erase(q)
that q must be a valid dereferenceable iterator into the sequence a.
</p>

<p>
However, 21.3.5.5, p5 describing string::erase(p) only requires that
p be a valid iterator.
</p>

<p>
This may be interepreted as a relaxation of the general requirement,
which is most likely not the intent.
</p>

<resolution>
<p>Remove <sref ref="[string::erase]"/> paragraph 5.</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>The LWG considered two options: changing the string requirements to
  match the general container requirements, or just removing the
  erroneous string requirements altogether.  The LWG chose the latter
  option, on the grounds that duplicating text always risks the
  possibility that it might be duplicated incorrectly.</p>
