<p>
The specification of <code>task</code> doesn't require symmetric
transfer which can help with stack overflow. Also, when another
<code>task</code> is <code>co_await</code>ed the scheduler on which
the <code>task</code> resumes is known and can be used to avoid
unnecessary scheduling by comparing the scheduler currently installed
by in two <code>task</code>s involved.
