The working draft ignores the possibility that:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>the value of an expression of integer-class type might not be representable by the target 
integer type of a conversion, and</p></li>
<li><p>the value of an expression of integer type might not be representable by the target 
integer-class type of a conversion.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Presumably the behavior of these cases is undefined by omission; is this actually the intent?   
<p/>
Notably (2) could be specified away by mandating that all integer-class types are capable of 
representing the value range of all integer types of the same signedness.
