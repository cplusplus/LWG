<p>
The main purpose of <code>affine_on</code> is to make sure work
resumes on a specific execution context. The scheduling operation
may take some time and work may be cancelled in the meantime. If
this cancellation causes the scheduling to be cancelled work cleaning
up after the cancellation would be executed on the wrong execution
context. Thus, the stop token from the receiver's environment should
only be forwarded when <code>connect</code>ing the sender but not
to the scheduling operation.
