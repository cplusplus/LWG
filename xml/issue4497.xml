<title>`std::nullopt_t` should be comparable</title>

<p>
`std::nullopt_t` currently has no comparison operators. This prevents perfectly reasonable code from working, 
like `ranges::find(v, nullopt)` where `v` is a <tt>vector&lt;optional&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt>, for no good reason. 
<p/>
Additionally, <tt>optional&lt;T&gt;</tt> has the full set of comparisons. But <tt>optional&lt;T&gt;</tt> is 
conceptually a <tt>variant&lt;nullopt_t, T&gt;</tt>, which wouldn't be comparable... because of `nullopt_t`. 
Other empty types like <tt>tuple&lt;&gt;</tt> and `monostate` are also comparable.
<p/>
Proposed resolution: Add a defaulted member <tt>operator&lt;=&gt;</tt> to `nullopt_t`.
