<p>
There is a level of redundancy in the library specification for many
algorithms that can be eliminated with the combination of concepts and
default parameters for function templates. Eliminating redundancy simplified
specification and reduces the risk of introducing accidental
inconsistencies.

<p>
Proposed resolution: Adopt

NAD, this change would break code that takes the address of an algorithm.

<blockquote>
<p>
Request 'Open'.  The issues in the paper go beyond just reducing
the number of signatures, but cover unifying the idea of the ordering
operation used by algorithms, containers and other library components.  At
least, it takes a first pass at the problem.
</p>

<p>
For me (personally) that was the more important part of the paper, and not
clearly addressed by the Summit resolution.

<p>Diamond operators make this easier, but it needs a paper.</p>
