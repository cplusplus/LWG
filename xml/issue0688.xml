<title>reference_wrapper, cref unsafe, allow binding to rvalues</title>
<section><sref ref="[refwrap.const]"/></section>

<p>
A <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> can be constructed from an rvalue, either by using
the constructor, or via <tt>cref</tt> (and <tt>ref</tt> in some corner cases). This leads
to a dangling reference being stored into the <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> object.
Now that we have a mechanism to detect an rvalue, we can fix them to
disallow this source of undefined behavior.
</p>

<p>
Also please see the thread starting at c++std-lib-17398 for some good discussion on this subject.

<p>
Now that <tt>ref/cref</tt> are constained that <tt>T</tt> must be an <tt>ObjectType</tt>, I do not
believe there is any risk of binding <tt>ref</tt> to a temporary (which would rely on
deducing <tt>T</tt> to be an rvalue reference type)
</p>
<p>
However, the problem for <tt>cref</tt> remains, so I recommend retaining that deleted
overload.

Without:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class T&gt; void ref(const T&amp;&amp; t) = delete;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
I believe this program will compile:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;functional&gt;

struct A {};

const A source() {return A();}

int main()
{
   std::reference_wrapper&lt;const A&gt; r = std::ref(source());
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
I.e. in:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;ObjectType T&gt; reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt; ref(T&amp; t);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
ref(source())
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
deduces <tt>T</tt> as <tt>const A</tt>, and so:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
ref(const A&amp; t)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
will bind to a temporary (tested with a pre-concepts rvalue-ref enabled compiler).
</p>
<p>
Therefore I think we still need the ref-protection.  I respectfully disagree with Alisdair's
comment and am in favor of the proposed wording as it stands.  Also, CWG 606
(noted below) has now been "favorably" resolved.

<resolution>
<p>
In <sref ref="[function.objects]"/>, add the following two signatures to the synopsis:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class T&gt; void ref(const T&amp;&amp; t) = delete;
template &lt;class T&gt; void cref(const T&amp;&amp; t) = delete;
</pre></blockquote>

</resolution>

<note>
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2292.html">N2292</a>
addresses the first part of the resolution but not the second.
</note>

<note>
Bellevue:  Doug noticed problems with the current wording.
</note>

<note>
post Bellevue:  Howard and Peter provided revised wording.
</note>

<note>
This resolution depends on a "favorable" resolution of CWG 606:  that is,
the "special deduction rule" is disabled with the const T&amp;&amp; pattern.
