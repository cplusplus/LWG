<p>
In <sref ref="[format.string.std]"/>, the meaning of "Unicode encoding" in the text added by
<a href="https://wg21.link/p1868r2">P1868R2</a> (the "Unicorn width" paper) is unclear.
<p/>
One interpretation of what is meant by "Unicode encoding" is "UCS encoding scheme"
(as defined by ISO/IEC 10646). Another interpretation is an encoding scheme capable of
encoding all UCS code points that have been assigned to characters. Yet another interpretation
is an encoding scheme capable of encoding all UCS scalar values.
<p/>
SG16 reflector discussion (with the LWG reflector on CC) indicates that the third option
above is the closest to the intent of the study group. The situation of the current wording,
which readers can easily read as indicating the first option above, is undesirable.
