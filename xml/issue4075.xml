<p>
<paper num="P0260R8"/> had a requirement for constructors and destructors of
concurrent queue value types to return on the same thread where it was called.
<p/>
During the discussion in Tokyo, SG1 decided this to be a general
issue and not specific to concurrent queues.

<note>2024-06-24; Reflector poll</note>
<p>
Set priority to 3 after reflector poll. Send to SG1.

<note>Kona 2025-11-06; Status changed: SG1 &rarr; NAD.</note>
<p>
SG1 response: It has been determined that this cannot happen.
The only facility which can change the thread is co-routines,
and they cannot apply to constructors and destructors (yet).
There is nothing to be done about this after all.
