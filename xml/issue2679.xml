<p>
- Some Effects: were intended to include the "Equivalent to" phrasing where no or different words were used.  See examples in std::filesystem and throughout the library.
</p>
<p>
- The wording in [structure.specifications]/4 is incorrect and Effects: throughout the library which use (or were intended to use) the "Equivalent to" phrasing need to be checked to make sure they fit the intended wording.
</p>

<p>
The PR is fine; but bullet #1 in the report really should have a list of places to change.
</p>
<p>Jonathan checked throughout the library for bullet #2 and found two problems in [string.access], which have been added to the PR.

<resolution>
<p>Change [structure.specifications]/4 as indicated:</p>

<p>
"[...] if F has no Returns: element, a non-void return from F is specified by the <del>Returns: elements</del><ins>return statements</ins> in the code sequence."
</p>

<p>Add two '<code>return</code>' keywords to [string.access]:</p>

<pre>
  const charT&amp; front() const;
  charT&amp; front();
</pre>
<p>7  <em>Requires:</em> <code>!empty()</code>.</p>
<p>8  <em>Effects:</em> Equivalent to <code><ins>return </ins>operator[](0)</code>.</p>

<pre>
  const charT&amp; back() const;
  charT&amp; back();
</pre>
<p>9  <em>Requires:</em> <code>!empty()</code>.</p>
<p>10  <em>Effects:</em> Equivalent to <code><ins>return </ins>operator[](size() - 1)</code>.</p>
</resolution>
