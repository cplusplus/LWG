<p>
When both grouping and showbase are active and the basefield is octal, 
does the leading 0 participate in the grouping or not?  For example, 
should one format as: 0,123,456 or 0123,456?
</p>
<p>
An analogy can be drawn with hexadecimal.  It appears that 0x123,456 is 
preferred over 0x,123,456.  However, this analogy is not universally 
accepted to apply to the octal base.  The standard is not clear on how 
to format (or parse) in this manner.

Insert into <sref ref="[facet.numpunct.virtuals]"/> paragraph 3, just before the last
sentence:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The leading hexadecimal base specifier "0x" does not participate in 
grouping.  The leading '0' octal base specifier may participate in 
grouping.  It is unspecified if the leading '0' participates in 
formatting octal numbers.  In parsing octal numbers, the implementation 
is encouraged to accept both the leading '0' participating in the 
grouping, and not participating (e.g. 0123,456 or 0,123,456).
</p></blockquote>

<rationale>
<p>
The current behavior may be unspecified, but it's not clear that it
matters.  This is an obscure corner case, since grouping is usually
intended for the benefit of humans and oct/hex prefixes are usually
intended for the benefit of machines.  There is not a strong enough
consensus in the LWG for action.
