    <title>is std::FILE a complete type?</title>

<p>
7.19.1, p2, of C99 requires that the FILE type only be declared in
&lt;stdio.h>.  None of the (implementation-defined) members of the
struct is mentioned anywhere for obvious reasons.
</p>

<p>
C++ says in 27.8.1, p2 that FILE is a type that's defined in &lt;cstdio>. Is
it really the intent that FILE be a complete type or is an implementation
allowed to just declare it without providing a full definition?
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>In the first sentence of <sref ref="[fstreams]"/> paragraph 2, change
  "defined" to "declared".</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>We don't want to impose any restrictions beyond what the C standard
  already says. We don't want to make anything implementation defined,
  because that imposes new requirements in implementations.</p>
</rationale>
