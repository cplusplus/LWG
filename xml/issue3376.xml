<sref ref="[iterator.concept.winc]"/> says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A type <tt>I</tt> is an <i>integer-class type</i> if it is in a set of implementation-defined class types 
that behave as integer types do, as defined in below.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
and
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A type <tt>I</tt> is integer-like if it models <tt>integral&lt;I&gt;</tt> or if it is an integer-class type.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Some implementations support built-in integer types that do not necessarily model <tt>std::integral</tt>, 
e.g. with libstdc++ whether <tt>std::is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;</tt> is <tt>true</tt> depends whether 
"strict" or "extensions" mode is in use. Because <tt>__int128</tt> is not a class type, it can't be used 
as an integer-like type in strict mode (which effectively means it can't be used at all, to avoid unwanted 
ABI differences between modes).
<p/>
The requirement should be relaxed to permit non-class types which are integer-like but not one of the 
standard integer types (nor extended integer types). If we do that, the name "integer-like class type" 
should probably change.
