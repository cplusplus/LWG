<title><tt>&lt;coroutine&gt;</tt> is freestanding, but uses <tt>std::hash</tt> which is not</title>

<p>
The <tt>&lt;coroutine&gt;</tt> header is required for freestanding implementations, but it defines a 
specialization of <tt>std::hash</tt>, which is not required for freestanding implementations.
<p/>
Presumably we should make the <tt>std::hash</tt> specialization conditionally present.
</p>

<note>2022-01-30; Reflector poll</note>
<p>
Set priority to 3 after reflector poll.
Would be resolved by <paper num="P1642"/> for C++23,
but it's still a defect in C++20.
</p>


<note>2025-11-11; Jonathan adds wording for C++20.</note>
<p>
This wording would resolve the defect for C++20,
but the issue should be closed as Resolved in C++23.

<resolution>
