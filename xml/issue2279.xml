<p>
I think that the effects of <tt>list::splice</tt> function should be stated more carefully.
<p/>
Function transferring a single element is described now in the following way (<sref ref="[list.ops]"/> p7):
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
void splice(const_iterator position, list&amp; x, const_iterator i);
void splice(const_iterator position, list&amp;&amp; x, const_iterator i);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> Inserts an element pointed to by <tt>i</tt> from list <tt>x</tt> before position and removes the element from
<tt>x</tt>. The result is unchanged if <tt>position == i</tt> or <tt>position == ++i</tt>. Pointers and references to <tt>*i</tt>
continue to refer to this same element but as a member of <tt>*this</tt>. Iterators to <tt>*i</tt> (including <tt>i</tt> itself)
continue to refer to the same element, but now behave as iterators into <tt>*this</tt>, not into <tt>x</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
But it is incorrect to talk about <tt>operator==</tt> for iterators that are not from the same container (after acceptance of 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3066.html">N3066</a>, <sref ref="[forward.iterators]"/> p2). 
So, the text operates with an undefined behaviour.
</p>

<p>
One is formally allowed to have list implementation where two iterators from different lists return true to <tt>operator==</tt>.
For example, this can only happen to non-dereferenceable iterators, and <tt>position</tt> and <tt>++i</tt> can be 
non-dereferenceable. So, literally according to the standard, it is not allowed in this implementation to transfer 
such elements with <tt>splice</tt> function.
</p>

Moved to NAD.
</p>
<p>
The condition under which the <tt>list</tt> is unchanged is not program code, so there is no undefined behavior to protect against.
Rather, the precondition that the evaluation can be performed is implicit if determining when the condition applies.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3691.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[forwardlist.ops]"/> p6 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
void splice_after(const_iterator position, forward_list&amp; x, const_iterator i);
void splice_after(const_iterator position, forward_list&amp;&amp; x, const_iterator i);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
[&hellip;]
<p/>
-6- <i>Effects:</i> Inserts the element following <tt>i</tt> into <tt>*this</tt>, following <tt>position</tt>, 
and removes it from <tt>x</tt>. The result is unchanged if <ins><tt>&amp;x == this</tt> and the following 
condition is satisfied:</ins> <tt>position == i</tt> or <tt>position == ++i</tt>. Pointers and references to 
<tt>*++i</tt> continue to refer to the same element but as a member of <tt>*this</tt>. Iterators to <tt>*++i</tt> 
continue to refer to the same element, but now behave as iterators into <tt>*this</tt>, not into <tt>x</tt>.
