Originally reported in <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/8579">cplusplus/draft#8579</a>.
<p/>
Currently, <sref ref="[headers]"/> p5 specially mentions "except for names which are defined as macros in C", 
which covers `std::fpclassify` and its friends. Perhaps we don't want to require them to be initially declared 
in namespace `std`. Moreover, <sref ref="[headers]"/> p6 seemingly requires them to be also defined as macros 
in C++, which doesn't seem intentional.
<p/>
Perhaps we want to exactly specify whether a name denotes a function (overload set) or a macro in C++, 
while no name should denote both a function and a macro, and to allow a function name from C initially declared 
in the global namespace.

"Seems consistent with what all the implementation actually do."
</p>
<p>
"Macros aren't 'declared' so saying 'declarations except macros' is confusing."

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <paper num="N5032"/>.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[headers]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[&hellip;]
<p/>
-5- Except as noted in <sref ref="[library]"/> through <sref ref="[exec]"/> and <sref ref="[depr]"/>, 
the contents of each header <tt>c<i>name</i></tt> is the same as that of the corresponding header 
<tt><i>name</i>.h</tt> as specified in the C standard library (<sref ref="[intro.refs]"/>). In the 
C++ standard library, however, the declarations (except for names which are defined as macros 
in C<ins>++</ins>) are within namespace scope (<sref ref="[basic.scope.namespace]"/>) of the namespace 
`std`. It is unspecified whether these names (including any overloads added in <sref ref="[support]"/> 
through <sref ref="[exec]"/> and <sref ref="[depr]"/>) are first declared within the global namespace 
scope and are then injected into namespace `std` by explicit <i>using-declarations</i> 
(<sref ref="[namespace.udecl]"/>).
<p/>
-6- Names which are defined as macros in <del>C shall be defined as macros in the C++ standard 
library</del><ins>the C++ standard library shall not be defined as functions</ins>, even if C 
grants license for implementation as functions.
[<i>Note 2</i>: The names defined as macros in C include the following: `assert`, `offsetof`, `setjmp`, 
`va_arg`, `va_end`, and `va_start`. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
<p/>
-7- Names that are defined as functions in <del>C shall be defined as functions in the C++ standard 
library</del><ins>the C++ standard library shall not be defined as macros</ins>.(138)
