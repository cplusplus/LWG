<sref ref="[ios.base]"/> defines <tt>ios_base::failure</tt> as a nested class:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
namespace std {
  class ios_base {
  public:
    class failure;
    [&hellip;]
  };
  [&hellip;]
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This means it is valid to use an elaborated-type-specifier to
refer to <tt>ios_base::failure</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
using F = class std::ios_base::failure;
throw F();
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Therefore implementations are not permitted to define
<tt>ios_base::failure</tt> as a typedef e.g.
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
 class ios_base {
 public:
#if __cplusplus &lt; 201103L
   class failure_cxx03 : public exception {...};
   typedef failure_cxx03 failure;
#else
   class failure_cxx11 : public system_error {...};
   typedef failure_cxx11 failure;
#endif
   [&hellip;]
 };
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This constrains implementations, making it harder to manage the ABI
change to <tt>ios_base::failure</tt> between C++03 and C++11.

<note>2015-05-06 Lenexa: Move to Ready</note>
<p>JW: the issue is that users are currently allowed to write "class failure" with an elaborated-type-specifier and it must be well-formed, I want the freedom to make that type a typedef, so they can't necessarily use an elaborated-type-specifier (which there is no good reason to use anyway)</p>
<p>JW: ideally I'd like this everywhere for all nested classes, but that's a paper not an issue, I only need this type fixed right now.</p>
<p>RD: is a synonym the same as an alias?</p>
<p>JW: dcl.typedef says a typedef introduces a synonym for another type, so I think this is the right way to say this</p>
<p>JW: I already shipped this last month</p>
<p>PJP: we're going to have to break ABIs again some time, we need all the wiggle room we can get to make that easier. This helps.</p>
<p>MC: do we want this at all? Ready?</p>
<p>9 in favor, none opose or abstaining</p>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N4296.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change the synopsis in <sref ref="[ios.base]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
namespace std {
  class ios_base {
  public:
    class failure; <ins><i>// see below</i></ins>
    [&hellip;]
  };
  [&hellip;]
};
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Change <sref ref="[ios.base]"/> paragraph 1:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<tt>ios_base</tt> defines several member types:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a <del>class <tt>failure</tt></del><ins>type <tt>failure</tt>, defined as either
a class derived from <tt>system_error</tt> or a synonym for a class</ins> derived from 
<tt>system_error</tt>;</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Change <sref ref="[ios::failure]"/> paragraph 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
-1- <ins>An implementation is permitted to define <tt>ios_base::failure</tt> as
a synonym for a class with equivalent functionality to class <tt>ios_base::failure</tt> shown 
in this subclause. [<i>Note</i>: When <tt>ios_base::failure</tt> is a synonym for another type 
it shall provide a nested type <tt>failure</tt>, to emulate the injected class name. &mdash; 
<i>end note</i>]</ins> The class <tt>failure</tt> defines the base class for the types of all 
objects thrown as exceptions, by functions in the iostreams library, to report errors detected 
during stream buffer operations.
