<p>
During the application of <a href="https://wg21.link/p0430r2">P0430R2</a>, we came across several terms that seem insufficiently 
clear and lacking proper definitions.
<p/>
We would like clarification on what those terms mean, and we would welcome wording suggestions, or alternatively a verbose explanation and dispensation to change the presentation editorially.
<p/>
The items in question are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What does it mean to 'always interpret [the character sequence] in the same way'? ([fs.enum.path.format], which is 
[path.format] in the paper)</p></li>
<li><p>What is a "directory-like" file type? ([fs.class.directory_iterator])</p></li>
<li><p>What is an "implementation-defined file type"? (e.g. [fs.op.copy])</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
In <sref ref="[fs.enum.path.format]"/> "always interpreted in the same way" means
irrespective of the <tt>path::format</tt> value, or the content of the string.
Maybe add ", rather than depending on the <tt>path::format</tt> value or the
content of the character sequence".
<p/>
In <sref ref="[fs.class.directory_iterator]"/> an "implementation-defined
directory-like file type" is an implementation-defined file type (see
<sref ref="[fs.enum.file_type]"/> and Table 115) that is treated like a directory by
the special rules that the OS has for non-regular files (see <sref ref="[fs.path.generic]"/>).
<p/>
In <sref ref="[fs.op.copy]"/>, an "implementation-defined file type" is exactly
that, see <sref ref="[fs.enum.file_type]"/> and Table 115 again. I don't see what
isn't clear about that. Maybe add a cross-reference to <sref ref="[fs.enum.file_type]"/>.
