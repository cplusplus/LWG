<b>Addresses <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/nbballot/issues/828">US 155-253</a></b>
<p>
“Subsumes” word does not work here because `regular_invocable` and `invocable` subsume each other. 
<p/>
Proposed change: Say that the type is required to model `regular_invocable`.

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <paper num="N5014"/>.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[algorithms.parallel.user]"/>, as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-1- Unless otherwise specified, invocable objects passed into parallel algorithms as objects of a 
type denoted by a template parameter named `Predicate`, `BinaryPredicate`, `Compare`, 
`UnaryOperation`, `BinaryOperation`, `BinaryOperation1`, `BinaryOperation2`, `BinaryDivideOp`, 
or constrained by a concept <ins>whose semantic requirements include</ins> that 
<del>subsumes</del> <ins>the type models</ins> `regular_invocable` and the operators used by the 
analogous overloads to these parallel algorithms that are formed by an invocation with the 
specified default predicate or operation (where applicable) shall not directly
or indirectly modify objects via their arguments, nor shall they rely on the identity of the 
provided objects.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
