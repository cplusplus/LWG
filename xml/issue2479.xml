<p>
How does <tt>wbuffer_convert</tt> use the <tt>cvtstate</tt> member?
<p/>
Is the same conversion state object used for converting both the get
and put areas? That means a read which runs out of bytes halfway
through a multibyte character will leave some shift state in cvtstate,
which would then be used by a following write, even though the shift
state of the get area is unrelated to the put area.
