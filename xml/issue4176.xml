<p>
We sometimes give detailed specifications of container members which add
additional specification to the common requirements in
<sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>, for example
<sref ref="[vector.modifiers]"/> defines `vector::erase` without actually
saying it erases any elements. The actual effects of `erase` are given in
<sref ref="[sequence.reqmts]"/>.
</p>
<p>
Authors of library wording often struggle with this non-local form of
specification, where we sometimes do spell out container member functions
in full, and sometimes rely on distant wording that applies to all containers.
It would be easier if `vector::erase` referred back to
<sref ref="[sequence.reqmts]"/>.
