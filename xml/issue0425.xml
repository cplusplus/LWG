<p>
The standard is not clear about the requirements on the value returned from
a call to get_temporary_buffer(0). In particular, it fails to specify whether
the call should return a distinct pointer each time it is called (like
operator new), or whether the value is unspecified (as if returned by
malloc). The standard also fails to mention what the required behavior
is when the argument is less than 0.
