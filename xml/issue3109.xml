<p>
In C++03 <tt>strstreambuf</tt> was not copyable, because <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> wasn't copyable.
In C++11 we made <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> copyable by derived classes, and <tt>strstreambuf</tt>
doesn't define any special members, so it (unintentionally?) became copyable, with completely
unspecified semantics.
<p/>
VC++ and libc++ make it movable not copyable, and libstdc++ still follows C++03, so it's neither
movable nor copyable. Making it movable seems to be the sane option, and consistent with
<tt>filebuf</tt> and <tt>stringbuf</tt>.
