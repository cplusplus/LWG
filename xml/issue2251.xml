<title>C++ library should define <tt>ssize_t</tt></title>
<section><sref ref="[support.types]"/></section>

<p>
The C++ standard library defines <tt>size_t</tt>, a typedef for an implementation defined unsigned integer type 
that can represent the sizes of objects. The POSIX standard augments this with <tt>ssize_t</tt>, a typedef for a 
signed integer type that corresponds to <tt>size_t</tt>.
<p/>
The <tt>ssize_t</tt> typedef is useful &mdash; useful enough that the C++ standard even refers to it. (In a 
non-normative footnote in <sref ref="[stream.types]"/>.)  Also, lots of OS vendors add it to their headers anyway, 
even though it isn't part of the C or C++ standards, because those vendors are trying to define headers that 
conform to multiple standards at once. We should make users' and implementers' lives easier by adding 
<tt>ssize_t</tt> to <sref ref="[support.types]"/>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Wording from Jayson Oldfather:</b>
<p> I decided to use the phrase to describe <tt>ssize_t</tt> below because of the text describing it in the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/sys_types.h.html#tag_13_67">POSIX</a> standard. In it, it describes <tt>ssize_t</tt> with the value range of <tt>[-1,{SSIZE_MAX}]</tt>.</p></p>

<p>
Ammend <sref ref="[support.types]"/>, Table 30 as indicated:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1">
<caption>Table 30 &mdash; Header <tt>&lt;cstddef&gt;</tt> synopsis</caption>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Name(s)</th>

<b>Types:</b>
</td>
<td>
<tt>ptrdiff_t <ins>ssize_t</ins> size_t max_align_t nullptr_t</tt>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>Add the following paragraph to describe <tt>ssize_t</tt></p>
<blockquote><p><ins>
-?- The type <tt>ssize_t</tt> is an implementation-defined signed integer type that shall contain the minimum range <tt>[-1, {SSIZE_MAX}]</tt>.
</ins></p></blockquote>
<p>Ammend p7 as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
-7- [<i>Note:</i> It is recommended that implementations choose types for <tt>ptrdiff_t<ins>, ssize_t,</ins></tt> and <tt>size_t</tt> whose integer conversion ranks &hellip;</p></blockquote>
