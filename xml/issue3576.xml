<p>
The paper <paper num="P1868"/> "width: clarifying units of width and precision in
<tt>std::format</tt>" added optional Unicode support to the <tt>format</tt> header.
This paper didn't update the definition of the fill character, which is defined as
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"The fill character can be any character other than <tt>{</tt> or <tt>}</tt>."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This wording means the fill is a character and not a Unicode grapheme cluster. Based
on the current wording the range of available fill characters depends on the
<tt>char_type</tt> of the format string. After P1868 the determination of the required
padding size is Unicode aware, but it's not possible to use a Unicode grapheme clusters
as padding. This looks odd from a user's perspective and already lead to implementation
divergence between libc++ and MSVC STL:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The WIP libc++ implementation stores one <tt>char_type</tt>, strictly adhering
to the wording of the Standard.</p></li>
<li><p>MSVC STL stores one code point, regardless of the <tt>char_type</tt> used. This
is already better from a user's perspective; all 1 code point grapheme clusters are
properly handled.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
For the width calculation the width of a Unicode grapheme cluster is estimated to be 1 or 2.
Since padding with a 2 column width can't properly pad an odd number of columns the grapheme
cluster used should always have a column width of 1.
<p/>
The responsibility for precondition can be either be validated in the library or by the user.
It would be possible to do the validation compile time and make the code ill-formed when the
precondition is violated. For the following reason I think it's better to not validate
the width:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>P1868 14. Implementation</p>
<blockquote><p>
"More importantly, our approach permits refining the definition in the future if there is
interest in doing so. It will mostly require researching the status of Unicode support on
terminals and minimal or no changes to the implementation."
</p></blockquote>
<p>When an estimated width of 1 is required it means that improving the Standard may make
previously valid code ill-formed after the improvement.</p></li>
<li><p>P1868 13. Examples</p>
<p>The example of the family grapheme cluster is only rendered properly on the MacOS terminal.
So even when the library does a proper validation it's not certain the output will be
rendered properly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Changing the fill type changes the size of the <tt>std::formatter</tt> and thus will be an ABI break.
<p/>
The proposed resolution probably needs some additional changes since the Unicode and output
width are specified later in the standard, specifically <sref ref="[format.string.std]"/>/9 - 12.
