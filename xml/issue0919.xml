<title>(<tt>forward_</tt>)<tt>list</tt> specialized remove algorithms are over constrained</title>

<p>
The signatures of <tt>forwardlist::remove</tt> and <tt>list::remove</tt>
defined in <sref ref="[forwardlist.ops]"/> before 11 + <sref ref="[list.ops]"/> before 15:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
requires EqualityComparable&lt;T&gt; void remove(const T&amp; value);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
are asymmetric to their predicate variants (which only require
<tt>Predicate</tt>, <em>not</em> <tt>EquivalenceRelation</tt>) and with the free algorithm
remove (which only require <tt>HasEqualTo</tt>). Also, nothing in the
pre-concept WP
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2723.pdf">N2723</a>
implies that <tt>EqualityComparable</tt> should
be the intended requirement.

<p>
We agree with the proposed resolution,
but would like additional input from concepts experts.
</p>
<p>
Move to Review.

<blockquote><p>
Current rationale and wording for this issue is built around concepts. I
suggest the issue reverts to Open status. I believe there is enough of
an issue to review after concepts are removed from the WP to re-examine
the issue in Santa Cruz, rather than resolve as NAD Concepts.

<blockquote><p>
Recommend NAD: The concept-free wording as of
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2960.pdf">N2960</a>
has no longer the
over-specified requirement
<tt>EqualityComparable</tt> for the remove function that uses <tt>==</tt>. In fact, now
the same test conditions exists
as for the free algorithm <tt>remove</tt> (<sref ref="[alg.remove]"/>). The error was
introduced in the process of conceptifying.
