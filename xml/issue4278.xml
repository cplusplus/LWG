<p>
During LWG review of <paper num="P3481R3"/> it was noted that we need to say "except that `sndr` 
is only evaluated once" because it's used in <tt><i>get-domain-early</i>(sndr)</tt>, but that 
exposition-only-function doesn't actually use its argument, it only cares about the type, and 
it default constructs a `Domain` of a type determined by using the type of `sndr`.
<p/>
If we had something like:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class Sender&gt;
using <i>get-domain-early-t</i> = decltype(<i>get-domain-early</i>(declval&lt;const Sender&amp;&gt;()));
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
then we wouldn't need to use `sndr` twice in expressions that currently use <tt><i>get-domain-early</i>(sndr)</tt>.
</p>

<p>
A re-design, but we're already doing it for <i>get-domain-late</i>.
