<p>
<code>affine_on</code> is specified to take a sender and a scheduler
as arguments. The scheduler is meant to match the scheduler obtained
from the <code>get_scheduler</code> query on the receiver's
environment.  Thus, the scheduler argument is redundant and the
semantics become weird if these two schedulers don't match. The
<code>affine_on</code> algorithm should only take the sender as
argument.
