<p>
Normally, the <code>get_allocator</code> query forwards the allocator
from the receiver's environment. For <code>task</code> the
<code>get_allocator</code> query used for <code>co_await</code>ed
senders uses the allocator passed when creating the coroutine or
the default if there was none. It should use the receiver's
environment, at least, if the receiver's environment supports a
<code>get_allocator</code> query.
</p>
<p>
Supporting the receiver's allocator isn't always possible: the used
allocator type needs to be known when the coroutine is created. At
that time the receiver isn't known, yet. As a result the receiver's
environment may provide an allocator which is incompatible with the
allocator type used by the coroutine. It may be possible to use the
receiver's allcoator if it is convertible to the allocator type
used by the coroutine and to produce a compile-time error otherwise.
