        <p>

The Effects clause in 27.4.4.3, p5 describing the effects of a call to
the ios_base member function clear(iostate state) says that the function
only throws if the respective bits are already set prior to the function
call. That's obviously not the intent. If it was, a call to clear(badbit)
on an object for which (rdstate() == goodbit &amp;&amp; exceptions() == badbit)
holds would not result in an exception being thrown.

The text ought to be changed from
<br/>

"If (rdstate() &amp; exceptions()) == 0, returns. ..."
<br/>

to
<br/>

"If (state &amp; exceptions()) == 0, returns. ..."
