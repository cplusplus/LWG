I see that the definition the associated Laguerre
polynomials <sref ref="[tr.num.sf.Lnm]"/> has been corrected since
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1687.pdf">N1687</a>.
However, the draft standard only specifies ranks of integer value <tt>m</tt>,
while the associated Laguerre polynomials are actually valid for real
values of <tt>m &gt; -1</tt>.  In the case of non-integer values of <tt>m</tt>, the
definition  <tt><i>L</i><sub>n</sub><sup>(m)</sup> = (1/n!)e<sup>x</sup>x<sup>-m</sup> (d/dx)<sup>n</sup> (e<sup>-x</sup>x<sup>m+n</sup>)</tt>
must be used, which also holds for integer values of <tt>m</tt>.  See
Abramowitz &amp; Stegun, 22.11.6 for the general case, and 22.5.16-17 for
the integer case.  In fact fractional values are most commonly used in
physics, for example to <tt>m = +/- 1/2</tt> to describe the harmonic
oscillator in 1 dimension, and <tt>1/2, 3/2, 5/2, ...</tt> in 3
dimensions.
</p>
<p>
If I am correct, the calculation of the more general case is no
more difficult, and is in fact the function implemented in the GNU
Scientific Library.  I would urge you to consider upgrading the 
standard, either adding extra functions for real <tt>m</tt> or switching the
current ones to <tt>double</tt>.
