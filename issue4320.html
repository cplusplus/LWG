<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Under 23.3.9.4 <a href="https://wg21.link/hive.modifiers">[hive.modifiers]</a> p4 complexity is stated as "Constant.
Exactly one object of type <code class='backtick'>T</code> is constructed."
<p/>
However the approach to implementation necessary to support 8/16-bit
types without artificially widening the type storage, as described under
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p0447r28.html#non_reference_implementations_info">
"Additional info for supporting small types" in P0447</a> basically specifies 
time complexity which is <code class='backtick'>Log(n)</code> (on most platforms, log64 or log32) in the 
capacity of the element block selected to insert into. This time complexity only occurs 
during the operation to find an erased element memory location within a block 
which is known to have one, and does not involve the elements themselves.
<p/>
This is both the simplest and fastest solution to supporting small types
in hive without artificial widening that I have come across.
<p/>
Further, I have discovered that this approach can be extended to larger
block capacities via 
<a href="https://plflib.org/matt_bentley_-_bitset_stacking.pdf">"bitset stacking"</a>
while retaining <code>&#x1d4aa;(log n)</code> intra-block lookup time complexity, 
regardless of block capacity. Overall this approach would be useful for embedded 
and other memory-scarse platforms as it reduces the 16-bit-per-element cost of the
reference implementation down to a 1-bit-per-element cost. For 64-bit and larger types, 
there are other ways to obtain this reduction without
losing <code>&#x1d4aa;(1)</code> lookup but it is unclear whether those methods would 
in fact be faster. For approaches involving bitset-stacking, the logarithmic 
complexity also occurs during erasure, specifically adding a couple of extra 
instructions for every 64x (i.e. bit-depth) increase in block capacity. But again 
this does not involve the elements and is logarithmic in the capacity of the block 
erased from.
<p/>
Regardless, the increased complexity during insertion is necessary for small-type support.
<p/>
There was ambiguity as to whether this should result in a change to <code>hive</code> 
time complexity when discussed on the reflector, as it is unrelated to element numbers (unless 
all elements fit within one block), but it is related to block capacities, which are defined 
as part of the <code class='backtick'>hive</code> technical specification.

<p><i>[2025-09-26; Matt comments and provides improved wording]</i></p>

<p>
Past LWG/LEWG telecon discussion around this topic concluded that because elements are not involved, 
and the logarithmic action is within the capacity of a block (a fixed number), not the size of the 
sequence, and the actual performance cost is negligible, that the complexity of these actions are 
in fact constant. But there is some disagreement on this.
<p/>
One possibility is to add additional complexity data to each of the effected functions. This would 
impact on <code class='backtick'>emplace</code>, range <code class='backtick'>insert</code>, fill <code class='backtick'>insert</code>, <code class='backtick'>shrink_to_fit</code>, <code class='backtick'>reshape</code>, move- and copy 
assignment operator, <code class='backtick'>erase</code> and <code class='backtick'>unique</code>. However I feel this is overkill and may confuse 
implementors as the log(n) complexity is not permitted to involve elements.
<p/>
Having looked into it and sought feedback I think a blanket note on 23.3.9.1 <a href="https://wg21.link/hive.overview">[hive.overview]</a> p3 
would be sufficient, such that the time complexity is limited to "techniques to identify the memory 
locations of erased elements". Otherwise we need to stay with the previous resolution that this 
is in fact constant time behaviour.
