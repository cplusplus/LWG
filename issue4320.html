<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
Under 23.3.9.4 <a href="https://wg21.link/hive.modifiers">[hive.modifiers]</a> p4 complexity is stated as "Constant.
Exactly one object of type <code class='backtick'>T</code> is constructed."
<p/>
However the approach to implementation necessary to support 8/16-bit
types without artificially widening the type storage, as described under
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p0447r28.html#non_reference_implementations_info">
"Additional info for supporting small types" in P0447</a> basically specifies 
time complexity which is <code class='backtick'>Log(n)</code> in the capacity of the element block selected 
to insert into (when erased element memory locations are available for reuse) but 
imposes a small maximum block capacity cap. This time complexity only occurs 
during the operation to find an erased element memory location within a block 
which is known to have one.
<p/>
This is both the simplest and fastest solution to supporting small types
in hive without artificial widening that I have come across.
<p/>
Further, I have discovered that this approach can be extended to larger
block capacities via 
<a href="https://plflib.org/matt_bentley_-_bitset_stacking.pdf">"bitset stacking"</a>
while retaining <code>&#x1d4aa;(log n)</code> intra-block lookup time complexity, 
regardless of block capacity. Overall this approach would be useful for embedded 
and other memory-scarse platforms as it reduces the 16-bit-per-element cost of the
reference implementation down to a 1-bit-per-element cost. For 64-bit and larger types, 
there are other ways to obtain this reduction without
losing <code>&#x1d4aa;(1)</code> lookup but it is unclear whether those methods would 
in fact be faster.
<p/>
Regardless, it is necessary for small types. In all cases <code>N</code> is capped by
the maximum block capacity defined in the implementation.
<p/>
There is ambiguity as to whether this should result in a change to <code>hive::insert/emplace</code> 
time complexity when discussed on the reflector, as it is unrelated to element numbers (unless 
all elements fit within one block), but it is related to block capacities, which are defined 
as part of the <code class='backtick'>hive</code> technical specification.
<p/>
The exact mechanism by which erased element locations are recorded (for later reuse 
23.3.9.1 <a href="https://wg21.link/hive.overview">[hive.overview]</a> p3) in <code class='backtick'>hive</code> is not specified in the technical
specification. The issue is therefore in some ways similar to <code class='backtick'>deque</code> <code class='backtick'>insert/emplace</code> 
time complexity, where a <code class='backtick'>push_back</code> may in fact result in a <code>&#x1d4aa;(n)</code> 
operation in the number of blocks &mdash; but because we do not specify the storage 
mechanism in <code class='backtick'>deque</code>, we ignore the fact that deques are typically constructed as 
vectors of pointers to blocks, and therefore any insert may trigger vector expansion. 
This was also the reasoning discussed for <code class='backtick'>hive</code> during LWG talks, since it can also 
be implemented as a vector of pointers to blocks.
<p/>
In addition, if we were to support approaches involving bitset stacking, this would 
also affect functions which can erase elements, since the number of modifications to 
the bitset-stack of a given block would increase by 1 with every 64x increase (assuming 
64-bit words) in block capacity.
</p>
<blockquote class="note">
<p>
I do not personally believe any wording change are necessary here, based on
precedents set by the existing standard and what has been conveyed to me
in the past regarding this topic (<code>&#x1d4aa;</code> complexity within blocks). 
However reflector discussion on the subject has not been entirely conclusive
since the relevance of some time complexity involves a degree of subjectivity. 
This issue has therefore been submitted in order for a definitive conclusion 
to be reached on the issue.
</p>

<p>
<b>Changes necessary:</b>
<p/>
Making this change would affect any functions which may reuse existing
erased-element memory locations. This includes:
<p/>
23.3.9.4 <a href="https://wg21.link/hive.modifiers">[hive.modifiers]</a>:<br/>
(<code class='backtick'>emplace</code>) p4<br/>
(range <code class='backtick'>insert</code>) p9<br/>
(fill <code class='backtick'>insert</code>) p13
<p/>
23.3.9.3 <a href="https://wg21.link/hive.capacity">[hive.capacity]</a>:<br/>
(<code class='backtick'>shrink_to_fit</code>) p10<br/>
(<code class='backtick'>reshape</code>) p24
<p/>
(both of the above functions may potentially relocate existing elements
from one block to erased element locations in another)
<p/>
23.3.9.2 <a href="https://wg21.link/hive.cons">[hive.cons]</a>:<br/>
(<code>operator= &amp;</code>) p27<br/>
(<code>operator= &amp;&amp;</code>) p31
<p/>
(move assignment will switch to moving individual elements where
allocators are not equal - and in the case of non-trivial/allocating
types, move-assigning to existing elements in the source may be beneficial)
<p/>
In addition, if we were to support bitset-stacking approaches these also
effect functions which erase individual elements. This includes:
<p/>
23.3.9.4 <a href="https://wg21.link/hive.modifiers">[hive.modifiers]</a>:<br/>
(<code class='backtick'>erase</code>) p16
<p/>
23.3.9.5 <a href="https://wg21.link/hive.operations">[hive.operations]</a>:<br/>
(<code class='backtick'>unique</code>) p11
</p>


<p id="res-4320"><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
This wording is relative to <a href="https://wg21.link/N5014">N5014</a>.

[<i>Drafting note:</i> I am unclear on whether <code class='backtick'>assign()</code> and <code class='backtick'>assign_range()</code> operations 
would require specification since they also have the capability to reuse existing erased 
element memory spaces, but we do not currently supply time complexity wording for these 
in the standard in general and I'm unsure why that is.]
